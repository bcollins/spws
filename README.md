Overview
========

This library was motivated by [SPServices][spslink] which is a useful,
but hard to extend library.  The goal of `spws` is to make this
library more modular and configurable.  Think of the C++ adage: we
don't want to pay for what we don't use (that goal isn't as possible
in Javascript as in C++, but you get the idea...).

You may also notice that there is no revision history beyond the
initial commit of this repository.  That is because the original
author(s) of [SPServices][spslink] chose not to actually use the
collaborative features of codeplex, like source control, such as they
are.
